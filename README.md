# rust-bitcoin-node

I'm writing a bitcoin full node implementation to learn about how bitcoin works in detail. I'll be using the rust-bitcoin library for most of the bitcoin primitives. The aim is to write a safe, concurrent and asyncronous implementation and I'll be using the latest rust features like async/await. A lot of the implementation details will follow how bcoin works because I have experience with JavaScript and no experience with C++.

Please don't only rely on this node for validating the chain.
